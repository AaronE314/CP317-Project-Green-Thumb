    <p class="title">GreenThumb Software Requirement Specifications (Version 1.0)</p>
    <h1 >1. Introduction</h1>
    <h2 >1.1 SRS Purpose and Overview</h2>
    <p >This document covers the software requirements for the GreenThumb application, as well as its features. Its intended audience is the client, David Brown, as well as the GreenThumb team, who will refer to the document to create objectives and monitor progress. It is organized according to the IEEE Std 830.</p>
    <h2>1.2 SRS Scope</h2>
    <p>The product discussed in this document is GreenThumb, a mobile application that identifies plants using image recognition and allows guests and users to search a plant database. The application allows users to upload photographs of plants to expand the gallery of plants available for other users to see and expand the machine learning&rsquo;s training material. The objective of the mobile application is to educate its users on with general species information.</p>

    <h1  >2. Overall Description</h1>
    <h2  >2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
    <p >Similar apps to GreenThumb, such as the Florist app and PictureThis app, exist. Although the Florist app can only identify flowers, the PictureThis app has most of the intended features of GreenThumb, although, as GreenThumb is being developed primarily as a learning experience, this does not pose any issues.</p>
    <h3  >2.1.1 System Interfaces</h3>
    <p >There are three primary components to the GreenThumb app:</p>
    <p ></p>
    <ol  start="1">
        
        <li ><b>Frontend</b>: the component of the GreenThumb application responsible for the GUI and integration with the user&rsquo;s Android device.</li>
        <li ><b>Backend</b>: the component of the GreenThumb application responsible for running the API that allows the frontend to communicate with the database. The ML primarily occurs here.</li>
        <li ><b>Database</b>: the tables containing the information on each species of plant, as well as user information and user-uploaded photographs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3  >2.1.2 User Interface</h3>
    <ol  start="1">
        <li>Splash: Page that appears on launch, shows the logo while the app loads</li>
        <li>Login: Appears on first launch, or if no Google account is registered. This page prompts the user to log in through google.</li>
        <li>Main Menu: Has buttons to link to the scan and search pages, as well as a button on top to access settings. Displays a white rose behind the logo in the background.</li>
        <li>Settings: Has an about section, a link to the login page if a user would like to change accounts, and a font size slider.</li>
        <li>Scan page: Allows the user to scan plants and submit them to be identified.</li>
        <li>Search page: Allows users to search for different types of plants.</li>
        <li>Plant Bio page: Has info about the plant a user has scanned or searched for. Is linked to from the search or scan pages upon a successful scan or a search.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: none of the above images represent the final GUI, but are to be used a example of what one could look like, and will change over the course of the project based on input from users/team members.)</p>

    <h3 >2.1.3 Communications Interfaces</h3>
    <p >GreenThumb uses Google&rsquo;s Sign In integration to include user accounts.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.draw.io/js/viewer.min.js"></script>
    
    <h2  >2.2 Product Functions</h2>
    <p >The intended primary functions of GreenThumb are as follows:</p>
    <ul >
        <li >Identify plants and access corresponding species information by uploading an image.</li>
        <li >Posting images of a species to its database page.</li>
        <li >Upvoting/downvoting images on a plant&rsquo;s page, to filter out low-quality images without admin intervention, allowing useful pictures to appear first.</li>
        <li >Search the plant database for species that meet certain parameters.</li>
        <li >Saving a user&rsquo;s viewing history for quick access later.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2  >2.3 User Characteristics</h2>
    <p >The intended audience for GreenThumb is individuals with an interest in identifying plants, including campers, who may wish to learn the possible dangers of a plant, parents, who could use the app as an educational tool for their children, and gardeners. There will be three primary types of users:</p>

    <ol  start="1">
        <li ><b>Guest</b>: A user with limited privileges within GreenThumb. They may upload photos to have their plants identified, but these photos will not be posted to the corresponding species&rsquo; page. They do not have access to photo upvoting, downvoting, or reporting options. A guest can become a registered user by logging into GreenThumb with their Google account.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol  start="2">
        <li ><b>Registered User</b>: A user with the privileges of a&nbsp;guest, along with the ability to post photos to the page for a species of plant, and upvote, downvote, or report the photos of other users. A registered user can remove their own photos.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol  start="3">
        <li ><b>Admin</b>: A user with the privileges of a registered user, along with the ability to remove the photos of other users, add a species to the database, update an existing species in the database, and remove a species from the database.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 >2.4 Constraints</h2>
    <p >Presently, no iOS version of GreenThumb is planned, as too few team members have access to a personal Mac device on which to write code. Should this change, an iOS version will likely be developed. No use of a mapping services such as Google Maps is planned, either.</p>
    <h2>2.5 Assumptions, Dependencies</h2>
    <p >It is assumed that all devices using GreenThumb have a camera with which to take photographs, and have access to at least the&nbsp;Android 5.0 &ndash; Lollipop operating system. Furthermore, a user must have access to the internet at all times while using GreenThumb.</p>
    <h2>2.6 Apportioning of Requirements</h2>
    <p >The following features may appear in a later version of GreenThumb:</p>
    <ul >
        <li >Creation of an iOS version of the application.</li>
        <li >Gardening information for applicable species.</li>
        <li >Supplier information for seeds.</li>
        <li >Location pinning for plant types.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 >3. Specific Requirements</h1>
    <h2 >3.1 Functions</h2>
    <p >Guests can use the following functions:</p>
    <ul >
        <li >Log into their existing Google account.</li>
        <li >Upload a plant photo and receive the identification.</li>
        <li >Browse the plant database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p >Registered users can use all the functions of a guest and:</p>
    <ul >
        <li >Post photos to the corresponding species page.</li>
        <li >Delete own photos.</li>
        <li >Upvote/downvote/report photos.</li>
        <li >View browsing history.</li>
        <li >Clear browsing history.</li>
    </ul>

    <p >Admins can use all the functions of a registered user and:</p>
    <ul >
        <li >Delete another user&rsquo;s photos.</li>
        <li >Add a new species page.</li>
        <li >Update an existing species page.</li>
        <li >Delete an existing species page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2  >3.2 Performance Requirements</h2>
    <p >The app should be able to scale and handle simultaneous interactions with the database. Most of the images should be able to be predicted in seconds, though the higher the resolution the image is and the slower the devices hardware is the longer it will take. The responsiveness of the app is dependant on the speed of the user's internet connection, as the requested data must be fetched from the server.</p>
