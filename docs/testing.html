    <h2> <a id="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
    <h3> <a id="Overview"></a>1.1 Overview</h3>
    <p>GreenThumb is a mobile application capable of running on Android devices. It allows users to upload a photograph of a plant and have its species determined by image recognition and machine learning, as well as browse a database of plants. Further, registered users can upload their photographs to the appropriate species’ page, where they can be seen by other users.</p>
    
    <h2><a id="Test Staff"></a>2. Test Staff</h2>
    <h3><a id="QA Team"></a>2.1 QA Team</h3>
    <p>The QA sub-team designs and assigns tests to the other members of the group and records the results of these tests. In the case that a test fails, the creator of the code is notified by the QA team so changes can be made before the code is re-tested. In the case of non-code portions of the product, the QA team assigns an individual who is not the creator to read over the writing and compare it with the official style guide as well as check for any spelling or grammar mistakes. This person must fix any inconsistencies and log what changes were made to improve the document. The team must ensure that all tests are logged within the GreenThumb Test Log document.</p>

    <h3><a id="Testers"></a>2.2 Testers</h3>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the entire team to test code and documents, the QA team simply assigns tests to other members of the team.</p>
    
    <h2><a id="Test Procedures"></a>3. Test Procedures</h2>
    
    <h3><a id="Test Type"></a>3.1 Test Type</h3>
    <p>Both black box testing and glass box testing is used when testing code. Code is checked to see if it works the way it is supposed to and if it is neat. </p>
    
    <h3><a id="Readability"></a>3.2 Readability</h3>
    <p>Code should be easy to read and understand as it makes testing and fixing code much easier. Good variable names are important. They must be meaningful, make sense for the variable’s use, and be camelCase. Testers are to ensure variable names are consistent. Use ‘this_name’ for private functions, ‘this._name’ for protected functions, and ‘this.name’ for public functions.</p>
    
    <h3><a id="Test Logs"></a>3.3 Test Logs</h3>
    <p>All tests, problems, and fixes are logged by the testers and team members making changes within the GreenThumb Test Log document. The QA team must make sure that everything is logged and designate a priority for any errors that need to be fixed (Low, Medium, High). A status of code being tested must also be assigned (Needs Testing, Being Tested, Tested, Needs Fixing, Being Fixed, Fixed).</p>
    
    <h2><a id="Error Fixing"></a>4. Error Fixing</h2>
    <h3><a id="Fixers"></a>4.1 Fixers</h3>
    <p>It is not the responsibility of the team member testing to fix the errors found in the tested code. The tester must notify the author of the code as well as the QA team when testing is done and about any errors found. It is then the responsibility of the code author to fix the code errors (if any) or to notify the QA team to assign someone to fix the errors. Once errors are fixed, the code must be tested again until there are no errors found.</p>
